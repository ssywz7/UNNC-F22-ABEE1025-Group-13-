U-value calculator
	Background: Used to calculate the thermal insulation performance of building materials.
	Motivation: The U-value formula is relatively complicated, and the calculator can simplify the steps to get the answer directly.
	Key function: Enter the thermal conductivity and thickness of each material to obtain the thermal conductivity of the target building material.
	Basis: R=d/k (k is thermal conductivity and d is thickness)
	Main formula: U=1/(R_1+R_2+⋯+R_n)=1/(d_1/k_1 +d_2/k_2 +⋯+d_n/k_n)
